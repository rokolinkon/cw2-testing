# Software Testing
## Welcome
Welcome once again to the lab on testing! This one should be simpler than the last one—we'll focus on testing the other method that I didn't go over in the slides, the `from_roman` method! I've included a copy of the code in `clean_code.py` according to the refactors done in the last lab (though not all of it will be the same, to save time—but it'll work the same from an end-user perspective) so that we can write unit tests for it, as well as a file called `test_RomanNumeralConverter.py` in which tests from the presentation as well as tests you write during this lab will be stored.
